1. collection of value - unique values
2. can contain diff data types(even object)
3. dynamically sized
4. dont maintain insertion order(first added may not be first element)
5. sets are iterables (for of)



sets vs array

# set is unique elems array may contain duplicates
# no insertion order in set but in array insertion order is there
# searching and deleting of elements in set is much faster than array
